Putting your data at risk by storing API keys, passwords or other credentials in code or scripts?

SimpleSecretService.com is a new tool to allow you to setup your secrets or parameters in the cloud and access easily from all your code or systems. 
This works great with OpenAI ChatGPT, Amazon AWS credentials, MySql, Azure, Google Cloud GCP and other databases, etc. 
I created this secure by design service because I was running code on Kaggle, AWS instances and my local system and didn't want to accidentally expose my keys through Github or a filesystem. 
The website has samples of accessing your secrets using a single line of code with a helper function or Curl command for Linux, Python, Javascript, HTML, Powershell or .bat file.
