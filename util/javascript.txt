I'm having trouble getting fetch on https to work reliably in node or in a browser.  
  The editor.html page works and can be used in as a code sample, but if I simplify the same file to have a simple form, then the fetch doesn't return data properly even when the
  server code returns expected 200 data. Similarly in node this code returns text "[object promise]" and I'm not sure why. contact me at apienhancement @ gmail dot com if you can 
  get a simple working sample.

  should work properly in async function but returns response text [object promise].
  
    try {
        let response = await fetch(url);
        if (!response.ok) {
            throw response;
        }
        let response_text = await response.text();
        session = response_text;
    }
    catch (error) {
        throw error;
    }
